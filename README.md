# Simply Dark Chrome Extension

**Simply Dark** is a lightweight Chrome extension that allows you to toggle a dark mode overlay for any webpage, including PDFs. Designed for ease of use, this extension uses a minimalistic overlay and intuitive controls, making it perfect for users who spend long hours browsing or reading online.

## Features

- **Dark Mode Overlay**: Applies a dark mode effect to any webpage or PDF using a high-contrast overlay.

## How It Works

- For **standard web pages**, the extension injects a semi-transparent overlay using `mix-blend-mode: difference`, transforming light colors into darker shades.
- For **PDFs**, the extension utilizes Chrome's scripting API to dynamically inject the dark mode script for seamless compatibility.
